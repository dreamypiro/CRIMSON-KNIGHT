# CRIMSON-KNIGHT
 Game Jam

 we started the project on 14-03-25 at 6:00pm 
 This project is made using godot engine as its a free to use and a light software and it met all the demands perfectly for our needs to bulid a 2d-platformer

 The assets used in this project are all royalty free and with lisencing provided by the makers
 the cut scenes in the whole project was hand drawn and animated by us and therefore are our own intellectual property 

The movment in the game :
1.forward -right arrow key
2.backward- left arrow key
3.jump-upward arrow key

 A breif discription on the scenes :

 1.menu.tscn - this is the scene for the menu of our project
 2.platform.tscn - it is the scene for the first castle and the platforms in it 
 3.start_of_the_game.tscn -it is the scene in the begining of the game which is also a tutorial to the controlls of the game 
 4.monsterpalace1.tscn - it is the scene which is used for building the second castle 
 5.cutscenes.tscn - there are an total of 4 cutscenes in the project which where handrawn 

 Reason behind the choice of track 1: 
 we choose track one as it felt like a suitable choice for our 2d game we feel like this game would resonate with the coustomer as its main gameplay and theme is around the 
 evergreen classic games such as mario , jumpking and we where heavily inspired by games such as blasphamous for a making a story plot based game also we felt that the general track allowed us to experiment with our project 

 What we could have done better?:-
 initially we planed on adding collectibles and a fighting aspect to the game but scince we had not pre prepared any assets the time was of a constraint 

 What we learned :-
 we explored and understood numerous new nodes in gdot and the benefits of using such an game engine also we learned the inns and out of github and the importance of github for a development
